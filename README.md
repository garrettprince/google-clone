## General Information
- More experience with React and Next using a basic Google Search template. Important introduction into APIs from Google and implementation of Server Side Rendering via Next.js. Implementation of Tailwind is always fun and each static clone I build is only more practice under my belt.


## Technologies Used
- Next - v12.1.5
- React - v18.1.0
- TailwindCSS - v3.0.24

## Features
- Responsive media sizing through Tailwind
- Page routing and pagination through Next Router
- Direct implementation of Google Search API
- CSS Grid implementation for responsive footer

## Project Status
Project is: _complete_ 


## Room for Improvement
- Does not contain exact pagination design as Google's search page, could look better
- Could implement loading/buffering signal for a better user experience
